# PythonActivityLabWorkwithStrings

Introduction:

Security analysts work with a lot of string data. For example, some security analysts work on
creating and updating IDs such as employee IDs and device IDs, which are commonly represented
as strings. As another example, certain network activity will be stored as string data. Becoming
comfortable working with strings in Python is essential for the work of a security analyst.

Scenario:

Youâ€™re working as a security analyst, and you are responsible for writing programs in Python to automate
updating employee IDs, extracting characters from a device ID, and extracting components
from a URL.
